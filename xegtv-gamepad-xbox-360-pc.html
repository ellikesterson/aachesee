                            <p> I'mn considering getting myself DS3 to use as a pad for my PC which, as far as I understand, is possible. I have aa question though - all info I've read thus far seems to imply that DS3 uses wireless communication, via Bluetooth by default, and I'm wondering if it can, instead, communicate with the computer via USB or is USB only used for charging it and not communication. Money is no object. The advantages of the console have moved me from the PC and returned to the console. In terms of Devil May Cry 4 of course. Have both, dunno what to choose. Just want to have discussion while waiting to PC release. 
So I'm considering buying Dark Souls, but I'm curious as to which platform has the better version. Since the PC version is a port, I'd like to make sure it actually works well on PC before spending the money on it, otherwise I'm just going to pick it up on 360. TL;DR: Does Dark Souls work well on PC, or is it better Hey everyone, I want to try working out and playing poe at the same time. I have a treadmill and a decent-ish PC. I want to grind the treadmill and to play at the same time. With this comes the understanding my favourite game is too complex for a controller, but surely a spin-to-win character can do it. I only want to pick up valuable drops. Can anyone help me out it you know how to set up a controller to grind low level maps with? Thanks in advance. Hey there. So I've been a PC-centric gamer since I started gaming. I love everything about the PC, from mods, to the vast back catalogue, to more recent advances such as Steam, cloud support etc. However, I can't help but feel as though I'm missing out on a bunch of great games by not owning a console. I'm currently debating as to whether or not I should just take the plunge and buy myself a PS3/360. I have a few questions, however. 1) Is it worth the money? Are the exclusives good enough. I use Razer Onza, they are flimsy, but they work like wonder in all the games that I have played so far. but when i plug it in my laptop, game will come up with all the interface with xbox controller set up (press start, press a b x y and whatnot) but won't work. It used to that if i press the home button, it would work (only homebutton, nothing else) but now even that doesn't work anymore. I had spare one laying around (I had it for L4D splitscreen) and even that one doesn't work. I tried. 
lately, I have come into playing more PC games than console games. I find it to be an all around better experience, however, Using my laptop to game is a bit of a pain in the ass with the touch pad mouse and the keyboard. I know purists will tell me this is how they were intended and it is the best way (and there is nothing wrong with that opinion), but I find it nearly unbearable sometimes (L4D2, Portal). I have been using my PS3 controller lately, but the second joystick I have a logitech dual action that I want to use as a controller for XBMC on my Raspian. However, I can't get it to do anything for the life of me. I have a keymap in the keymap folder, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I have tried the xserver-joystick, but as xbmc is run standalone, that seems to bypass it. I have scanned through the xbmc.log file, and don't see it even see my gamepad. Anybody have any idea what to do? I have also tried to use joy2key, but I can't figger I've tried everything, looked all over the internet, and done everything I could. It is not an issue with the controller, as I've tested it with other games. I wanted to post here as a last resort. I've found no solution over 2 days of trying to fix it. I have no idea if this is an issue with a recent update or not, but I seem to be the only one on the internet having this problem. The only workaround I've found is switching the right stick to be the movement stick, and left stick to be camera.

I've been using an old generic wired 360 controller for years, but it's starting to die on me. The stick rubber is starting to peel off and the cord is fucked up and turns the whole controller off whenever I move it from a neutral resting position. Should I buy another one, try an xbone controller, or are there any good third party controllers with layouts similar to xbox controllers? I'd definitely accept ones of those too, assuming it'll last me as long as a first party controller. 
So i recently got the service and im loving playing the exclusives. Im using a 360 controller on pc but while in game the controller still moves the mouse across the screen as well as some buttons input as a keyboard and as a gamepad at the same time. Anyone habe this issue or no how to make it switch to gamepad only while in game. Google hasnt helped ALBUM ( PLEASE COMMENT IN THIS POST BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO PM ME.

Also, recently got a Switch as a gift, but I'm much more of a PCMR person (ie. pre-ordered an EVGA 1080ti SC2 and need to pay for it). Unless otherwise marked, prices include shipping, I won't list item sold until I have received payment. I will make my best effort to have things packaged and mailed next business day. I'm really just looking for money ATM, but if you have some unique trades. 
Hi, I want to play the Mass Effect Trilogy on the TV with a gamepad. On which Platform should I play? One Option is the Xbox 360, another one would be the PC Version via Steam in Home streaming on my HTPC. The PC version needs an additional mod for gamepad support, I don't know how good this mod is. However, the game is much cheaper on PC, I can get it for about 8 EUR for all three games. Are all the DLCs like the alternate ending also available on Xbox360.
